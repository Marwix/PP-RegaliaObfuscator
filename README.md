# PP-RegaliaObfuscator

A simple .NET chartype Obfuscator (Made back in 2015, updated 2020).

# Information

This is a simple .NET obfuscator which can obfuscate any framework (.NET) executable file and rename the properties within the file to either arabic, japanese or brille with your desired length (5-30). This obfuscator doesn't necessarily change the size of the output file, nor does it change the functionality. Check the images below further down for more information. 

OBS: This obfuscator will not
protect your application to 100%. There is no way to fully protect a .NET application, because there will always be a way to reverse
engineer the software.

The obfuscator will rename the following parts:
- Variables (Only arabic)
- Functions
- Symbols
